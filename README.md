We have been able to analyze and capture credential on a HTTP connection using wireshark to track conversation between a web server and the client web browser, then we isolate the HTTP packets using the filter.
Next, we analyze the HTTP packets and we are able to see the login details in readable plain test because it is weak and insecure.
We also discovered that every conversation on the HTTP network is open and accessable to attackers/threat actors because  we did the same process on a port 443 web server but the credentials we was suppossed to spot and sniff in the HTTP cookies section happened to appear in an encrypted format.
So we advise that no one should use HTTP to set up their connection and internet users should also not login to any HTTP web page, it is highly risky and can result in credential theft and personal information can be exploited.
Now as we can see that the HTTP is not safe for users, we are recommending HTTPS, as a better option and SSL/TLS as a secure and safer protocol on websites.
