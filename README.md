[text](<../../GROUP 5 PRATICAL RESULT.pcapng>)
we have been able to analyze ans capture credential on a http connection because it is weak and unsecure for users 
every conversation on the http open and accessable to attackers/threat actors.
so we advise the no one should use http to set up their connection and internet users should also not login to any http web page, it is highly risky and can result in credential theft and personal infomation can be stoling.
